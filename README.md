# udacity-project-02-launch-configuration

There will be two parts to this project:

1. First develop a diagram that can be presenedt as part of my portfolio and as a visual aid to understand the CloudFormation script.
2. The second part is to interpret the instructions as well as my own diagram and create a matching CloudFormation script.
